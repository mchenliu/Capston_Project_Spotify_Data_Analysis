# Introduction
:mega: In this project, I analyzed my Spotify streaming history, covering both music tracks and podcast shows from 2018 to 2024. The goal is to uncover insights into my listening habits and predict future listening trends. This project is split into five parts:
1. [Data Collection and Preparation](/1_Data_Collection_and_Preparation/)
2. [Exploratary Data Analysis](/2_Exploratary_Data_Analysis/)
3. [Data Analysis](/3_Data_Analysis/)
4. [Visualization](/4_Visualization/)
5. [Problems](/5_Problems/)

## Tools Used

  - Pandas: Used for data cleaning and manipulation.
  - Spotipy: Used to fetch artist genres.
  - dotenv: Used to securely manage my Spotify API keys.
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
- :notebook: Jupyter Notebooks: Used to run my Python scripts and seemlessly integrate notes and analysis.
