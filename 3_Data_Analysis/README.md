# Questions to Answer
Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:  
1.  Who are the top 10 most played artists and podcast shows? ðŸŽ¶

# Analysis
### :one: Who are the top 10 most played artists and podcast shows? ðŸŽ¶

View my notebook with detailed steps here :point_right: [1_Top_10_Most_Played.ipynb](/3_Data_Analysis/1_Top_10_Most_Played.ipynb) 

**Code Implementation**

``` python
sns.barplot(
    x=top_artists.values,
    y=top_artists.index,
    ax=ax[0],
    palette=sns.color_palette('Blues_r',len(top_artists)),
    hue=top_artists.index # #assign y variable to hue
)
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Most Played Artists by Count')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('Play Counts')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x,_: f'{int(x/1000)}K'))
```

**Result**

View my notebook with detailed steps here :point_right: [2_Genre_Analysis.ipynb](/3_Data_Analysis/2_Genre_Analysis.ipynb)  
**Code Implementation**  
```python
# select top 10 genres and sort in descending order
genre_count_sorted = genre_count.sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
# create pie chart with matplotlib
labels = top_genre.index
sizes=top_genre.values
plt.pie(
    sizes,
    labels=labels,
    #format percentage with 1 decimal place
    autopct='%1.1f%%',
    # rotate the first slice to start at 120 degree
    startangle=120,
    colors=sns.color_palette('Blues_r',n_colors=len(labels)),
    pctdistance=0.8 #pull percentage labels away from centre
)
plt.title('Genre Distribuion', fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```  
**Result**

)
# move legend to right
plt.legend(loc='center left',bbox_to_anchor=(1,0.5), title='Artist')
